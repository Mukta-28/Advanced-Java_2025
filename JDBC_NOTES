------------------JDBC-------------------------

JDBC:

1)java.util.date contains both date and time. 
Whereas, java.sql.date contains only date.

2)Since the JDBC connection takes time to establish. 
Creating connection at the application start-up 
and reusing at the time of requirement, 
helps performance of the application.

3) PreparedStatement in Java improves performance 
and also prevents from SQL injection.

4) java.sql.Time contains only time. 
Whereas, java.sql.TimeStamp contains both time and date.

5)setAutoCommit(false) does not commit transaction 
automatically after each query. 
That saves a lot of time of the execution
and hence improves performance.

6)setAutoCommit(false) does not commit transaction 
automatically after each query.
That saves a lot of time of the execution and hence improves performance.

7)setMaxRows(int i) method is used to limit the number of rows 
that the database returns from the query.

8)addBatch() is a method of JDBC batch process. 
It is faster in processing than executing one statement at a time.

9)rollback() method is used to rollback the transaction. 
It will rollback all the changes made by the transaction.

10)JDBC connection isolation level.
TRANSACTION_NONE
TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED
TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ

11)The Jdbc driver that directly communicates with database protocol is 
- TYPE IV

12)Which driver can be used for internet purpose?
-TYPE III

13) " ? " character is used to represent an input parameter in a PreparedStatement

14)Which class gives u connection from connection pool?
-DataSource

15)Which class gives connection?
-DriverManager

16)According to JDBC4, driver class name should be there inside 
-: META-INF\services\java.sql.Driver file 

17)If we use query statement inside “execute()” method of Statement, it will return 
-TRUE

18)If we use update statement inside “execute()” method of Statement, it will return 
-FALSE

19)When driver is not found, it results in 
-CLASSNOTFOUNDEXCEPTION

20)Connection is Interface.

21)Name the most suitable execution method in JDBC , for firing DML queries.
-executeUpadate()

22)How to create PreparedStatement in order to support Scrollable and Read-only ResultSet?
con.prepareStatement(sql,TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE,CONCUR_READ_ONLY);

23)6. PreparedStatements are actually _________________
-: Compiled 

24)Which driver is efficient and always preferable for jdbc applications?
 -: Type – 4

25)The parameters of PreparedStatement object are ______ when the user clicks on the query button.
-: Initialized

26)Name of Type4 driver is
-: Native-Protocol Driver

27)By default ResultSet is
-TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY

28). PreCompiled SQL statements are stored in
-PreparedStatement

29)The checked exception which we need to handle in case of jdbc is
-SQLException

30)Type1 driver makes use of-odbc

31)If ResultSet is Scrollable we can invoke-
A: Absolute B: Next C: Previous

32). Stored Procedures can be called using - CallableStatement

33)Every driver class has ________ which registers itself with the DriverManager 
-Static Block
