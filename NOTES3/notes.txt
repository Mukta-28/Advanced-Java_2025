✅ MOST IMPORTANT TOPICS TO REVISE FROM YOUR DOC:
🔶 1. 🔥 Spring Boot Annotations to Remember (with Example Use)
Annotation	Description
@SpringBootApplication	Combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan
@RestController	Combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody for REST APIs
@RequestMapping / @GetMapping / @PostMapping	To handle web requests
@Autowired	For Dependency Injection
@Qualifier("beanName")	To resolve multiple bean injection conflicts
@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller	For stereotype annotations to define layers
@Scope("prototype")	To define bean scope
@Configuration	To define Spring config class
@Bean	To define a method that returns a Spring bean
@Value("${property}")	To inject values from application.properties
@Transactional	To enable database transactions (rollback if error)
@ControllerAdvice	Global exception handler
@ModelAttribute	To bind form data to model
@PathVariable / @RequestParam	To map path/URL or query parameters
@ResponseBody / @RequestBody	To map request/response JSON
@EnableAutoConfiguration	Auto-configure Spring beans based on classpath

🔶 2. 💡 Spring Boot MCQ You Must Practice (from the shared text)
Some of the most likely to be asked:

✔ @Autowired, @Inject, @Resource all can be used for DI ✅

✔ ApplicationContext → handles configuration, scanning, injection ✅

✔ @Service → used for business logic layer ✅

✔ @Controller vs @RestController ✅

✔ @ControllerAdvice for exception handling ✅

✔ @Transactional for DB operations ✅

✔ Spring IoC container = Bean Lifecycle Manager ✅

✔ Difference between Bean Definition and Bean Instance ✅

✔ @Scope(“prototype”) vs Singleton ✅

✔ Maven & Gradle for dependency management ✅

✔ @Value reads from application.properties ✅

🔶 3. ✨ Quick Project Ideas from Your List (if viva/project asked)
Here are easy to explain and scoring ones:

Project	Features You Can Say
✅ Ecommerce Shopping	Login, product listing, cart, order
✅ Movie Booking	Search movies, select seat, book ticket
✅ Hospital System	Patients, doctors, appointments
✅ Gym Management	Members, plans, billing
✅ Pizza Delivery	Menu, delivery, online payment
✅ Crime Reporting	Complaint registration, admin actions

📚 What to Do Now?
✅ Revise annotations from the list above.

✅ Practice all 30–40 Spring MCQs (you already pasted).

✅ Pick one project for viva (know 5 features, tables, and tech stack).

✅ Keep this link handy for videos:

 scopes in JSP


ChatGPT said:
In JSP (JavaServer Pages), scopes define how long an object is available and where it can be accessed within a web application.

There are 4 types of scopes in JSP:

✅ 1. page scope
Lifespan: Exists only in the current JSP page (until response is sent).

Accessed via: pageContext object.

Common Use: Temporary variables used only in the current page.

jsp
Copy
Edit
<jsp:useBean id="user" class="com.example.User" scope="page"/>
🔹 Example:
jsp
Copy
Edit
<%
  pageContext.setAttribute("name", "Wagh", PageContext.PAGE_SCOPE);
%>
Name: <%= pageContext.getAttribute("name", PageContext.PAGE_SCOPE) %>
✅ 2. request scope
Lifespan: Available for one HTTP request (across multiple JSPs via forward/include).

Accessed via: request object.

Common Use: Passing data between pages using RequestDispatcher.

jsp
Copy
Edit
<jsp:useBean id="user" class="com.example.User" scope="request"/>
🔹 Example:
jsp
Copy
Edit
<%
  request.setAttribute("msg", "Hello from request scope");
%>
You can access msg in another JSP forwarded to using:

jsp
Copy
Edit
<%= request.getAttribute("msg") %>
✅ 3. session scope
Lifespan: Until the user's session is active (timeout/logout).

Accessed via: session object.

Common Use: User login info, shopping cart, etc.

jsp
Copy
Edit
<jsp:useBean id="user" class="com.example.User" scope="session"/>
🔹 Example:
jsp
Copy
Edit
<%
  session.setAttribute("username", "cdacUser");
%>
Welcome: <%= session.getAttribute("username") %>
✅ 4. application scope
Lifespan: As long as the application (server) is running.

Accessed via: application object (a.k.a ServletContext).

Common Use: Global settings, counters, config values.

jsp
Copy
Edit
<jsp:useBean id="config" class="com.example.Config" scope="application"/>
🔹 Example:
jsp
Copy
Edit
<%
  application.setAttribute("siteName", "CDAC Notes");
%>
<%= application.getAttribute("siteName") %>
🔁 Comparison Table:
Scope	Object Used	Lifetime	Visible To
page	pageContext	Only current JSP page	Current JSP only
request	request	One HTTP request	Forwarded/included pages
session	session	User session duration	All JSPs in session
application	application	Application lifecycle	All users & pages
